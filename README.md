- [*To be Taught, If Fortunate*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/to-be-taught-if-fortunate-becky-chambers/8021324?ean=9780062936011), Becky Chambers
    > Okay, so this book in particular is just beautiful. Four scientists go to the stars in search of life knowing that when they return home hundreds of years have passed. The book is about their dynamic, their journey, and the joy in pursuing knowledge for it's own sake 
- [*Detransition Baby*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/detransition-baby-torrey-peters/13816519?ean=9780593133385), Torrey Peters
    > I'm going to have a difficult time describing this book. It was my favorite book of 2023, it's queer, it's nuanced, it's relatable. Literally everyone should read this book. 
- [*Conversations with Friends*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/conversations-with-friends-sally-rooney/11167655?ean=9780451499066), Sally Rooney
    > Extra martial sex, and the anxieties of being 22. it's also just kind of about navigating relationships, and a few other things. I loved it, it's good
- [*I Keep my Exoskeletons to Myself*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/i-keep-my-exoskeleton-to-myself-marisa-crane/18815376?ean=9781646221295), Marisa Crane
    > This was my last read of 2023. I picked it up by chance and holy shit. Okay, so, the government gets rid of prisions and implements a system of public shame, humiliation, and othering for anyone that would be convicted of any crime. That's just the setting. The book itself is about grief and motherhood. it's so good.
